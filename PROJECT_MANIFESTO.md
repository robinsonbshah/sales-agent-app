# SetoBaghApp - Project Manifesto

## Vision Statement

SetoBaghApp is a comprehensive sales agent management system designed to revolutionize beverage distribution operations for Seto Bagh. Our vision is to create a mobile-first, transaction-based platform that empowers sales agents, streamlines operations, and provides real-time business intelligence.

## Mission

To develop a robust, scalable, and user-friendly system that:
- Simplifies field operations through transaction-based data capture
- Provides real-time visibility into sales activities and performance
- Enables data-driven decision making through comprehensive analytics
- Supports offline operations for reliable field work
- Scales from pilot deployment to enterprise-wide implementation

## Core Design Philosophy

### Transaction-Based Architecture (IMPLEMENTED)

**Innovation**: Instead of traditional separate tables for different activities, we use a single `VisitTransaction` table that captures ALL activities during a visit in one atomic operation.

**Benefits**:
- **Simplicity**: One API call per visit
- **Atomicity**: All-or-nothing data integrity
- **Offline Resilience**: Local storage with sync capability
- **Performance**: Optimized for mobile devices
- **Maintainability**: Simplified codebase and database design

**Implementation**: The `VisitTransaction` table contains fields for stock counts, orders, returns, payments, GPS coordinates, photos, and visit metadata - everything needed to capture a complete visit in one record.

## Technical Architecture

### Database Design
- **SQL Server**: Robust, enterprise-grade database
- **Transaction-Based**: Single table for all visit activities
- **Master Data**: Zone, Route, Staff, Outlet, Product management
- **Operational Data**: VisitTransaction, Payment, Attendance, StaffLogin
- **Supporting Data**: Target management (to be implemented)

### Mobile Application
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform mobile development
- **Offline-First**: Local data storage with sync capability
- **GPS Integration**: Location validation and tracking
- **Photo Capture**: Visual documentation of visits
